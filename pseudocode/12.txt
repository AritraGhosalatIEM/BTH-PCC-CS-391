Define the structure Node:
data (integer): holds the value of the node
after (pointer to Node): points to the next node in the linked list
Declare global variables head and tail of type Node*.
Define the function enqueue:
Input: value (integer)
Set tail->data to the value
Allocate memory for a new node and assign it to new
Set tail->after to new
Update tail with the new node
Define the function dequeue:
Set remove to head
Set ret to remove->data
Set head to remove->after
Free the memory allocated for remove
Return ret
Define the function main:
Declare variable N (unsigned integer)
Print "Number of nodes: "
Read N from user input
Declare an array name of characters with size N
Declare a 2D array graph of boolean values with size N x N
Print "Graph :"
For i in range 0 to N
Print " "
Read a character from user input and assign it to name[i]
For j in range 0 to N
- Read a boolean value from user input and assign it to graph[i][j]
Return 0
